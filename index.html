        <h1>derpcode</h1>

<p>A tape-based esoteric language based on internet slang.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>derpcode consists of two objects: a one-ended <strong>tape</strong> of zero-initialized binary values, and a <strong>pointer</strong> 
(i.e., Turing "head").</p>

<h2>Library</h2>

<table>
<tr>
<td><b>Command</b></td>
<td><b>Description</b></td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<td>herp</td>
<td>Flip the current bit.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<td>derp</td>
<td>Increment the pointer.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<td>a-derp</td>
<td>Decrement the pointer.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<td>.</td>
<td>Write the current bit and the next seven bits to stdout as an ASCII character.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<td>?</td>
<td>Get an ASCII character from stdin and store it in the current bit and the next seven bits.</td>
  </tr>
</table><h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>Any symbols (including whitespace) which are not defined in the above library table are ignored by the interpreter.</p>

<h3>Initiation</h3>

<p>Every derpcode program initiates with the commands <code>derp a-derp</code>.</p>

<h3>Termination</h3>

<p>A derpcode program is terminated by decrementing the pointer to -1 after flipping the 0 value, and running the 
print command. The last line of all derpcode programs is therefore:</p>

<p><code>herp a-derp.</code></p>

<h2>Implementations</h2>

<p>Implementations planned include:</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] python-based runtime interpreter (in development).</li>
<li>[ ] compiler down to C, in C.</li>
</ul><h2>Sample Programs</h2>

<h3>Hello World</h3>

<p>The following derpcode program prints the phrase "Hello world!" to the screen, and exits.</p>

<pre><code>derp a-derp.

herp a-derp.

<h2>Obfuscation</h2>

<p>As derpcode is based on widespread internet slang, its ease of human readability is hard to avoid. However, as the 
interpreter ignores non-library terms, an easy way to obfuscate derpcode is to simply intersperse your code within
another text document.</p>
