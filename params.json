The last line of all derpcode programs is therefore:\r\n\r\n`herp a-derp.`\r\n\r\n## Implementations ##\r\n\r\nImplementations planned include:\r\n\r\n- [ ] python-based runtime interpreter (in development).\r\n- [ ] compiler down to C, in C.\r\n\r\n## Sample Programs ##\r\n\r\n### Hello World ###\r\n\r\nThe following derpcode program prints the phrase \"Hello world!\" to the screen, and exits.\r\n\r\n```\r\nderp a-derp.\r\n\r\nderp herp derp derp derp herp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp.\r\nderp derp herp derp derp herp derp herp derp derp herp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp.\r\nderp derp derp derp herp derp derp derp herp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp.\r\n.\r\nderp derp derp derp derp derp herp derp herp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp.\r\n\r\nderp herp derp derp derp herp derp herp derp herp derp herp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp.\r\nderp herp derp derp herp derp derp herp derp herp derp herp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp.\r\nderp derp derp herp derp herp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp.\r\nderp derp derp herp derp herp derp herp derp derp herp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp.\r\nderp derp derp herp derp herp derp herp derp herp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp.\r\n\r\nderp derp derp derp herp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp.\r\nderp herp derp derp derp derp herp derp derp herp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp a-derp.\r\n\r\nherp a-derp.\r\n```\r\n## Obfuscation ##\r\n\r\nAs derpcode is based on widespread internet slang, its ease of human readability is hard to avoid. However, as the \r\ninterpreter ignores non-library terms, an easy way to obfuscate derpcode is to simply intersperse your code within\r\nanother text document.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
